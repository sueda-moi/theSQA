# Software Engineering Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of self-contained solutions to various software engineering problems and algorithmic challenges. Each project is designed to demonstrate best practices in terms of code quality, maintainability, and correctness.

The primary goal is to showcase the ability to understand complex requirements and deliver robust, well-tested code.

## Projects Overview

This collection includes the following projects:

* ### [Project 1: Merkle Root Calculation Library](./q1/README.md)
    * **Description:** A TypeScript library to calculate the Merkle Root of a data array. The implementation follows specific cryptographic and structural rules inspired by the Bitcoin protocol, resolving requirement ambiguities to deliver a correct and verifiable result.
    * **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, Jest.

* ### [Project 2: (Please Add a Descriptive Title Here)](./q2/)
    * **Description:** (Once you complete Q2, please add a one-sentence, professional description of what the project does).
    * **Tech Stack:** (List the technologies used, e.g., Rust, C#, etc.).

* ### [Project 3: (Please Add a Descriptive Title Here)](./q3/)
    * **Description:** (Once you complete Q3, please add a one-sentence, professional description of what the project does).
    * **Tech Stack:** (List the technologies used).

## Core Principles

Across all projects in this repository, the following principles were prioritized:

* **Maintainability:** Code is written to be clear, readable, and easily managed by a team.
* **Correctness:** Solutions are thoroughly verified with a comprehensive suite of tests.
* **Minimal Dependencies:** Runtime dependencies are avoided wherever possible to ensure a lean and secure final product.
